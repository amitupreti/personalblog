Hello there  I'm **Amit**.\
I hope you stumbled upon this website on purpose! Otherwise, let me introduce myself.\
\
I'm a Masters Student @ University of Alberta with specialization in Multimedia . Most of my projects and Learning Goals revolve around Deep Learning and Data Science.

My main focus is on build Deep Learning and Data Extraction systems/tools rather than to just display F1 scores and accuracy, so that they can have a real world use.

> “Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.”\
> ― Mahatma Gandhi

I mostly code in Nodejs and Python and write about things that what i enjoy on [medium](https://medium.com/@amitupreti) and on this website.  You can check out my opensource projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/amitupreti) or connect to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amitupreti/) if you want to say hi or discuss your Awesome project.

*Thank You for reading!*
