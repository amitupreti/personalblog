Hello there  I'm **Amit**.\
I hope you stumbled upon this website on purpose! Otherwise, let me introduce myself.\
\
I'm a Data Pipeline Engineer@[Grepsr](grepsr.com) living in Nepal . Most of my projects and Learning Goals revolve around Deep Learning and Data Science.

My main focus is on build Deep Learning and Data Extraction systems/tools rather than to just display F1 scores and accuracy.

I mostly code in Node.js and Python and write about things that what i enjoy on [medium](https://medium.com/@amitupreti) and on this website.  You can check out my opensource projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/amitupreti) or connect to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amitupreti/) if you have a cool project or and idea that you want to discuss.

*Thank You for reading!*
